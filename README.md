# Monty-Hall Simulation with N-doors
**Chew Jia Ler**

## Overview
A random project that I did out of curiousity when taking a shower - "What if there are more than 3 doors in the Monty-Hall problem?"

This simple Python script simulates the winrates of the Monty-Hall problem from 3 doors to 10 doors - with and without switching the choice of door.

## How to use

Go to your terminal/cmd and simply run the script `python3 main.py`. By default it runs for 5,000,000 iterations for each winrate calculation, for 3 doors to 10 doors.

To edit the parameters, simply change the parameters at the bottom of `main.py`.
